## Project Proposal

### Introduction
In a typical IT environment, critical issues are often managed through a ticketing system, which acts as a record of problems. The IT infrastructure consists of interconnected components, and when one fails, it can disrupt others, sometimes taking days to diagnose and resolve the root cause. Therefore, it's vital to promptly inform the responsible teams to prevent future occurrences.

Issues are usually reported by users to a helpline or Service Desk, but due to the complexity of IT systems, tickets are frequently misrouted, causing significant delays sometimes weeks before reaching the right team. To tackle this challenge, we're considering using Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology, which enables computers to understand and process human language, to streamline ticket routing.

### Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create an advanced ticket classification system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). This system aims to provide substantial assistance to the IT support team by streamlining ticket and request handling. Its core functionality is to accurately route tickets to the appropriate department and to expedite issue resolution by ensuring that requests don't end up in the wrong hands.

### Approach
LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-3, have proven to be powerful tools in transforming intelligent ticket routing and automated response systems.
